# Advertising Sales Analysis using Statistics & Linear Algebra

## Executive Summary
In this project, I analyze a real-world advertising dataset to understand how
different marketing channels (TV, Radio, Newspaper) influence product sales.
The analysis combines exploratory data analysis (EDA), dimensionality reduction
using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), linear regression modeling, and
statistical inference.

The goal is not only to build models, but to **interpret results and extract
actionable insights** that support data-driven decision making.

## Problem Statement

Companies allocate advertising budgets across multiple channels, but not all
channels contribute equally to sales. Understanding the effectiveness of each
channel is essential for optimizing marketing strategy.

This project aims to:
- Identify which advertising channels have the strongest impact on sales
- Explore relationships and correlations between variables
- Reduce redundancy among features using linear algebra techniques
- Build and interpret a linear regression model with statistical validation

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains advertising spending data along with corresponding sales.

### Features
- **TV**: TV advertising budget
- **Radio**: Radio advertising budget
- **Newspaper**: Newspaper advertising budget
- **Sales**: Product sales (target variable)

The dataset is suitable for statistical analysis, regression modeling, and
dimensionality reduction.
